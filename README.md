# LearningPerm

Code for "[Can Consumers Distinguish Persistent from Transitory Income Shocks?](http://web.econ.ku.dk/druedahl/papers/2018_LearningPerm.pdf)", [Druedahl](http://web.econ.ku.dk/druedahl) and [JÃ¸rgensen](http://www.tjeconomics.com), 2019.

## Requirements

1. MATLAB 
2. C++ compiler

The code was run and tested with "MATLAB 2018b" and "Intel Parallel Studio XE 2018 for C++" on a 64-bit Windows machine.

**vectorclass:** The code relies on the **vectorclass** library developed by [Agnar Fog](https://www.agner.org/optimize/#vectorclass).

**Alternative C++ compiler:** You can alternatively install the "MinGW GCC" C++ compiler extension to MATLAB. Set `intel = 0` in `run_00_all.m`. If you use another MATLAB version change the path to `libgomp.a` in `compile_mex.m` accordingly. 


## ReadMe

Everything can be run from `run_00_all.m`. It calls all the `run_*.m` files in the correct order.

1. **Input:** PSID data in `psid/*.txt`.
2. **Output:** All figures and tables are saved in `fig_tabs/`.

## PSID data

The used PSID data is found in `psid/*.txt`. 

To reproduce these txt-files run `psid/construct_data.do` varying the value of `scalar group` from 0 to 1 and 2. The code uses `psid/data3.dta` taken from the replication package for Blundell et. al. (2008). The `psid/construct_data.do` file is based on `mindist_AER.do` from this replication package.
